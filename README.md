# BEACON: A Bayesian Optimization Inspired Strategy for Efficient Novelty Search
This repo contains the codes for [BEACON: A Bayesian Optimization Inspired
Strategy for Efficient Novelty Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03616)

# Usage
We provide the code scripts for executing different SOTA novelty search algorithm including BEACON, MaxVar, and NS-EA.

BEACON
------------------------------
Run the following commands to execute BEACON under different problem setting:

For continuous feature space and single outcome problem:
```sh
python Continuous_SingleOutcome_BEACON.py.py
```
